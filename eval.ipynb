    "# 1. Tracing LLM calls with Weave\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Tracing is Important for LLM Application Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "In building reliable LLM-based applications, having a clear view into\n",
    "how your system behaves is crucial. That’s where “tracing” comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detailed Interaction Records**:\n",
    "   Tracing captures all the inputs, prompts, responses, and any user feedback.\n",
    "   By preserving this detailed record, you always have the context needed to\n",
    "   debug unexpected or incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rapid Issue Diagnosis**:\n",
    "   With thorough traces, you can pinpoint issues faster—often without\n",
    "   needing direct access to remote systems. Simply reviewing the logs can\n",
    "   reveal how a certain response was triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Collaboration and Sharing**:\n",
    "   Traces can be shared with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "   This not only streamlines collaboration but also ensures everyone is\n",
    "   working off the same “source of truth” when investigating bugs\n",
    "   or brainstorming improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Outlier Spotting and Performance Tuning**:\n",
    "   By tracking calls at scale, you can detect when responses deviate\n",
    "   dramatically from the norm, troubleshoot any failures, and identify\n",
    "   potential performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Facilitates Product Evolution**:\n",
    "   As you enhance or expand your LLM application, comprehensive\n",
    "   tracing data helps you make more informed decisions about what to\n",
    "   improve, remove, or refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "With W&B Weave, comprehensive tracing is just 1 line of code, and offers features such as:\n",
    "- Syntax highlighting specific to your use-case (Markdown, JSON, etc.)\n",
    "- Ability to share links with other members of your team\n",
    "- Ability to filter traces by function name, input, output, etc.\n",
    "- Tracking latency, token count and cost per call (and trends)\n",
    "- Code associated with the llm call and versioning\n",
    "- Ability to add metadata per trace\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to instrument existing code, you can use the `@weave.op` decorator to trace the function.  \n",

    "### Components of an Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluations generally consist of four key elements:\n",
    "- An **input prompt** that serves as the basis for the model's completion. This prompt often includes a set of variable inputs that are inserted into a prompt template during testing.\n",
    "- The **output** generated by the model in response to the input prompt.\n",
    "- A **\"gold standard\" answer** used as a reference for assessing the model's output. This can be an exact match that the output must replicate, or an exemplary answer that provides a benchmark for scoring.\n",
    "- A **score**, determined by one of the scoring approaches outlined below, which indicates the model's performance on the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "#TODO: Look at the dataset and try to match the input, output, gold standard each row\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Grading Approaches\n",
    "Evaluations can be time-consuming and costly in two main areas: creating questions and gold standard answers, and the scoring/grading process itself.  \n",
    "Developing questions and ideal answers is often a one-time fixed cost, albeit potentially time-intensive if a suitable dataset is not readily available (consider leveraging an LLM to generate questions!). However, scoring is a recurring expense incurred each time the evaluation is conducted, which is likely to be frequent. Therefore, designing evaluations that can be scored efficiently and economically should be a central priority.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three primary methods for grading (scoring) evaluations:\n",
    "- **Programmatic scoring:** This approach involves using standard code (primarily string matching and regular expressions) to assess the model's outputs. Common techniques include checking for an exact match against an answer or verifying the presence of key phrase(s) in a string. Programmatic scoring is the most optimal method when feasible, as it is extremely fast and highly reliable. However, not all evaluations are amenable to this style of scoring.\n",
    "- **Human in the loop:** In this approach, a human reviewer examines the model-generated answer, compares it to the gold standard, and assigns a score. While manual scoring is the most versatile method, applicable to nearly any task, it is also exceptionally slow and costly, especially for large-scale evaluations. Designing evaluations that necessitate manual scoring should be avoided whenever possible.\n",
    "- **Model-based scoring AKA LLM as a judge:** LLMs (especially Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini) are really good at grading themselves (or even outputs of other LLMs) especially in wide range of tasks that traditionally needed human judgement like tone in creative writing or accuracy in open-ended question, or classification. This model-based scoring is accomplished by creating a _scorer prompt_ for an LLM\n",
